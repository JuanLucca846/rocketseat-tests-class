# Tests E2E Class

This project was taken from the Rocketseat youtube class, and this class covers several topics about tests, some of the topics are:

- **Unit Test**: focuses on testing individual units of code in isolation.

- **Integration Test**: verifies the interactions between components.

- **E2E Test**: validates the entire system's behavior in real-world scenarios.

Together, these testing techniques contribute to building robust, reliable, and high-quality software systems.
